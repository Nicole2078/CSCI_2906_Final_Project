# Cat (Shape) Match!

This is a match 3 tile game. It was designed only in JavaFX

The Shapes for the game I created with: [SVGPath Builder](https://codepen.io/anthonydugois/pen/mewdyZ)

## How to Play:

1. Start the game. If there are matches when you load the board they will already be found and add to the score.
2. Mouse click on a tile (try to hit it on the center it's a little buggy)
3. Mouse click on a tile that is directly Up, Left, Right or Below the tile you first clicked on.
4. If they are a match after the swap to the tiles in the column or rows they will be removed and added to the score or if not swapped back.
5. If you see no more matches there is a shuffle button to mix the current tiles on the board around.

Note: This project is not a complete game and consists of only one board. I wanted more for it but ran out of time. Updates to follow in the future.
